Healthcare Data Analysis Using Power BI

In this project, I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to analyze healthcare data. The dashboard provides insights into patient demographics, treatment types, and performance metrics across various specialties.

Key Features:

Patient Care Overview:
Visualized the distribution of outpatient, day case, and inpatient treatments using pie charts.
Analyzed age statistics for different patient care types with bar graphs.

Performance Metrics:
Summarized key metrics such as the latest waiting list numbers and average waiting times.
Highlighted performance across specialties like Ophthalmology and Pediatric Orthopedics.

Interactive Visualizations:
Created interactive charts and graphs to allow users to drill down into specific data points.
Used slicers and filters to enable dynamic data exploration.

Data Integration:
Integrated multiple data sources to provide a holistic view of healthcare operations.
Ensured data accuracy and consistency through data cleaning and validation processes.

User-Friendly Interface:
Designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface for easy navigation and data interpretation.
Included tabs for different sections such as summary, detailed analysis, and specific metrics.
This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Power BI for creating insightful and interactive dashboards, enabling healthcare professionals to make data-driven decisions and improve patient care.
